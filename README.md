Hawkeye is the edge ingestion component for the tuplestream platform. Since both the [hawkeye sidecar](https://github.com/tuplestream/hawkeye-sidecar) and [tuplectl](https://github.com/tuplestream/tuplectl) are Go binaries, the sole officially supported client library for the TS [Data API](https://docs.tuplestream.com/integrating-with-your-stack/tuplestream-data-api) is also written in Go.
